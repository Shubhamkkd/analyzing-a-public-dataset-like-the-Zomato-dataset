We followed best practices to ensure that each visualization is clear, intuitive, and visually appealing, enabling effective data-driven storytelling.

âœ… Visual Design Principles Used:
Consistent Color Schemes: Applied distinct, harmonious color palettes for each chart type (e.g., warm tones for cuisines, cool tones for cost/rating).

Clear Titles & Labels: Every chart includes an informative title, axis labels, and legends to help users understand the data instantly.

Readable Fonts & Layouts: Fonts are appropriately sized for readability, and white space is used to reduce clutter.

Axis Scaling & Gridlines: Adjusted for precision â€” e.g., cost axis doesnâ€™t start at zero if it misrepresents relationships.

Tooltips (Interactive): Used in Plotly charts to allow hover-based exploration for deeper insights.

Chart Size Optimization: Responsive layout ensures visualizations are viewable without scrolling/cropping.

Annotations/Highlights: Key trends (like top cuisine or outlier cost values) are highlighted or commented.
