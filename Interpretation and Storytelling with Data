The goal of this project goes beyond just visualizing numbersâ€”itâ€™s about uncovering insights that matter and telling a story that connects the data to real-world restaurant trends and consumer behavior.

ðŸ§  Key Insights & Narrative
Top Cuisines Dominate Across Cities
North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food emerged as the most popular cuisines. These reflect Indiaâ€™s diverse food culture, while also indicating customer preferences for quick-service, affordable meals.

Delhi NCR Leads in Restaurant Density
The city has the highest number of Zomato-listed restaurants, indicating both high demand and strong market competition. It highlights a metropolitan focus on dining out and food delivery services.

Ratings vs. Cost Shows an Interesting Trend
Restaurants with moderate pricing (â‚¹300â€“â‚¹600) tend to have the best average ratings. This suggests that affordability often aligns with customer satisfaction, rather than high-end luxury.

Online Ordering Is Widespread, But Not Universal
While a large share of restaurants support online orders, several still rely on traditional dine-in or phone-based servicesâ€”highlighting potential for digital adoption in Tier-2/Tier-3 cities.

Cuisines and Ratings Vary By Location
Heatmaps and scatter plots reveal that customer preferences and satisfaction scores vary
ðŸ§© Storyline Flow
"Zomato is more than just a food delivery platformâ€”it's a reflection of urban eating habits. Through visual storytelling, this project explores how food choices, affordability, and digital adoption vary across Indian cities. It guides viewers from macro trends (like popular cuisines) to micro insights (like how pricing affects ratings), painting a comprehensive picture of Indiaâ€™s dynamic food culture."
